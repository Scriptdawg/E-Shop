      <p>
        Our chickens are raised in open areas inside large barns with modern
        air circulation systems. This is a healthy environment for birds,
        prevents disease and reduces fat content.
      </p>
      <p>
        We never use antibiotics or hormones in any of our poultry.
      </p>
      <p>
        We process our chickens at 6 to 8 pounds. They are large enough to
        accommodate stuffing and will feed a gathering of at least six people.
        You will find them tender and juicy with low fat content.
      </p>
      <p>
        Buy a whole chicken for your next family gathering or stock up your
        freezer with air sealed, fresh or frozen cuts!
